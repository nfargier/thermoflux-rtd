Case study iMM904 curation
==========================
  
In our curation of the iMM904 model, due to the limited information available for the membrane potential of organelles, we chose to allow the free leakage of ions (charges) across the membrane. 
Allowing free movement of charges between compartments prevents over-constraining the model to potentially incorrect information.
For more detailed analysis of charge transport or models where more information is available on membrane physiology then a constraint on the second law could be added for these charge transport reactions.
